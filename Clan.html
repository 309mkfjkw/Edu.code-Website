           <p id="alt"> Why we learn C language ?</p><br>
           <b> Learning C language is important for several reasons:</b><br><br>

<b>Foundation for Other Languages:</b> C is considered a foundational programming language. Many other languages, such as C++, Java, Python, <br>and even some modern languages, are based on or influenced by C. Understanding C gives you a deeper understanding of how programming languages work.<br><br>

<b>Efficiency and Control:</b> C provides low-level memory access, giving programmers greater control<br> over system resources. This is crucial for developing efficient, high-performance applications, particularly in systems programming, embedded systems, <br>and real-time computing.<br><br>

<b>Understanding of Computer Architecture:</b> Learning C helps you understand how computers work at a deeper level.<br> You'll gain insight into concepts like memory management, pointers, and hardware-level operations, which are <br>often abstracted away in higher-level languages.<br><br>

<b>Portability:</b> C programs are highly portable. Once you write a C program, it can run on different hardware and operating <br>systems with minimal modification, which is a key feature for software development.<br><br>

<b>System and Embedded Programming:</b> C is widely used in developing operating systems (like Linux), embedded systems,<br> device drivers, and other low-level applications. If you're interested in fields like hardware interfacing or<br> creating OS-like environments, C is essential.<br><br>

<b>Performance:</b> C is a compiled language, which means that the programs you write in C are typically<br> faster than those written in interpreted languages. This makes it suitable for performance-critical applications, like game development,<br> system utilities, and more.

<b>Legacy Code:</b> Many existing systems and applications were written in C. By learning it, you're able to read,<br> maintain, and update legacy code, which is often still in use today.<br><br>

<b>Learning Key Concepts:</b> Concepts like loops, conditions, arrays, structures, and pointers are introduced early in C. <br>These form the foundation for more complex programming concepts, and understanding them is critical<br> for any software developer.
